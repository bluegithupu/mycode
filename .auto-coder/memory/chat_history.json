Since you haven't provided the actual code, I'll give you a general idea of how you might do this in a typical Pygame-based Snake game.\n\n### Example Code Snippet\nHere's a hypothetical example of how you might change the background color in a Pygame-based Snake game:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\nimport sys\n\n# Initialize Pygame\npygame.init()\n\n# Set up display\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))\npygame.display.set_caption('Snake Game')\n\n# Set background color to black\nbackground_color = (0, 0, 0)  # RGB for black\n\n# Main game loop\nwhile True:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            pygame.quit()\n            sys.exit()\n\n    # Fill the screen with the background color\n    screen.fill(background_color)\n\n    # Update the display\n    pygame.display.flip()\n```\n\n### Steps to Modify Your Code\n1. **Identify the Background Drawing Code**: Look for the part of your code where the background is being drawn or filled. This is usually done with the `screen.fill()` method in Pygame.\n\n2. **Change the Background Color**: Modify the color parameter passed to `screen.fill()`. For black, you would use `(0, 0, 0)`.\n\n### Example of Modifying Your Specific Code\nIf your code looks something like this:\n\n```python\n# Somewhere in your code\nscreen.fill((255, 255, 255))  # Current background color (white)\n```\n\nYou would change it to:\n\n```python\n# Change background color to black\nscreen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n```\n\n### Summary\n- **Find the `screen.fill()` method** in your `snake_game.py` script.\n- **Change the color parameter** to `(0, 0, 0)` to set the background color to black.\n\nIf you provide more specific details or the actual code snippet, I can give you more precise instructions."}]}
