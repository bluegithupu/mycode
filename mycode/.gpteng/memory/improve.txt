PLANNING:
The error is caused by an attempt to open `file_path` outside the conditional block where it is defined. This happens because the second `with open(file_path, 'r') as f:` block is incorrectly indented and placed outside the `if` block that checks for the file extension. To fix this, we need to remove the second `with open(file_path, 'r') as f:` block and its associated `out.write` calls, as they are redundant and cause the error when `file_path` is not defined.

OUTPUT:
```python
file_reader.py
<<<<<<< HEAD
                    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                        out.write(f.read())
                    out.write("\n```\n\n")
