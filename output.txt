To change the background color of the Snake Game to white, we need to modify the `play` method in the `SnakeGame` class to set the background color to white instead of black. Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for this change:

```python
##File: /Users/mac/Desktop/gpt_test/auto_coder_test/snake_game.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            self.display.fill(self.black)
=======
            self.display.fill(self.white)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the background color of the game is set to white.
