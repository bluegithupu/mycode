To change the background color of the Snake Game to black, we need to modify the `snake_game.py` file. Specifically, we need to update the `self.white` variable to represent the new background color and then ensure that the background is filled with this color in the `play` method.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```python
##File: /Users/mac/Desktop/gpt_test/auto_coder_test/snake_game.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.white = (255, 255, 255)
=======
        self.white = (0, 0, 0)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```python
##File: /Users/mac/Desktop/gpt_test/auto_coder_test/snake_game.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.display.fill(self.white)
=======
        self.display.fill(self.white)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will set the background color to black and ensure that the background is filled with this color during the game.
