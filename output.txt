To complete the `display_difficulty_selection` method in the `SnakeGame` class, we need to implement the logic to display the difficulty options and highlight the selected difficulty. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to achieve this:

```python
##File: /Users/mac/Desktop/gpt_test/auto_coder_test/snake_game.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def display_difficulty_selection(self):
        # TODO: Implement difficulty selection logic
        pass
=======
    def display_difficulty_selection(self):
        options = ["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"]
        for i, option in enumerate(options):
            text = self.font.render(f"{option}", True, self.black if i != self.selected_difficulty else self.red)
            text_rect = text.get_rect(center=(250, 200 + i * 50))
            self.display.blit(text, text_rect)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This block will replace the `display_difficulty_selection` method with the completed implementation that displays the difficulty options and highlights the currently selected difficulty.
